EVEMU-DEVICE(1)
===============

NAME
----

     evemu-device, evemu-play, evemu-event  - create a virtual input device
     and replay an event sequence

SYNOPSIS
--------
     evemu-device [description-file]

     evemu-play /dev/input/eventX < event-sequence
     evemu-play event-sequence.txt

     evemu-event /dev/input/eventX [--sync] --type <type> --code <code> --value <value>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
evemu-device creates a virtual input device based on the description-file.
This description is usually created by evemu-describe(1). evemu-device then
creates a new input device with uinput and prints the name and the device
file to
stdout.

evemu-play replays the event sequence given on stdin through the input
device. The event sequence must be in the form created by evemu-record(1).
If the argument is a file containing a recording, evemu-play creates the device
and prompts the user for an interactive replay of the events.

evemu-event plays exactly one event with the current time. If *--sync* is
given, evemu-event generates an *EV_SYN* event after the event. The event
type and code may be specified as the numerical value or the symbolic name
from linux/input.h.

evemu-device must be able to write to the uinput device node, and evemu-play
must be able to write to the device node specified; in most cases this means
it must be run as root.
